Look out side of a window for 3 minutes and pay attention to what you see, birds, clouds, sky etc.

Take a huge deep breath, and let an out loud sigh (if youâ€™re alone) or a low sigh if in public

Leave the room or situation for 5 minutes

Focus on a solution

Take 2 minutes to forgive yourself

Go to sleep early today
