Acknowledge your concerns

Take a deep diaphragm breath through your nose and exhale slowly for 10 seconds out of your mouth

Go for a walk pick a color you see and notice how often that one color shows up

Sit down and look your worry straight in the eye to see if itâ€™s real or not

Set a time of the day to worry say between 3-4 pm and then let go after that

Make a worry list during 3-4 pm and see if they are real or warranted
