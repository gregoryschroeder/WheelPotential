Resentment is the gate keeper between hate and guilt and uses them to cause havoc with the other emotions. Its main job is to cause injury and insult to hate, anger, blame and worry. Resentment feels just and righteous when it stimulates hate, anger, blame and worry with no regards to facts or sincerity.
