Gratitude is a cousin of love and works in a similar way but goes one step further by taking action. Gratitude is putting love into action such as thanking someone for an act, buying someone a meal, saying nice things, helping us stay in the moment by being nice to the things in our lives every day, nice to our friends, family, ourselves, animals, the earth and so on. Gratitude breathes life into love which empowers us to go to the moon, soon to Mars, build tall buildings, magnificent structures, paintings, sculptures, create societies, education institutions etc.
