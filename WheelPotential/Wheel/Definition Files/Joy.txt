Joy brings us pleasure and delight which is a cousin of gratitude. Joy's desire is to make sure we are valued and appreciated. It feeds off of love and gratitude and its intensity and magnitude increases when love and gratitude are completely engaged with each other. Joy helps us feel gladness and festive with the celebration of life.
