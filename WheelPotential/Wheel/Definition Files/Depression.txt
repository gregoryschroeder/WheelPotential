Depression is the direct cousin of guilt and overloads the emotions of resentment, hate, anger, blame and worry. It is designed to help you feel low in spirit by drawing on the energy of guilt, resentment, hate, anger and blame. Depression holds up all of the other emotions except fear, and tries to drag them down where it is living.
