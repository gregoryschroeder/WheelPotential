Anger is the expression of boredom, annoyance, worry and blame and uses them as weapons against other emotions. Anger is the gatekeeper between blame and hate. It is the emotion that loses composure because it is caught up in the middle of boredom, annoyance, worry and blame. Its sole purpose is to express discontent even if it isn’t “just” or “real”.
